        <p> Ready to add some spice to your Sudoku life? These techniques will make those numbers dance to your tune:</p>
        
        <div class="technique">
            <h2>1. Pairs and Triplets (Number Buddies)</h2>
            <p>Sometimes two cells in the same row, column, or box can only contain the same two numbers (like 4 and 7). These are called 'pairs' - they're like best friends who won't let any other numbers sit with them. This means those two numbers can't appear anywhere else in that row, column, or box!</p>
            <p>Example: If two cells in a row can only be 4 or 7, and you find a third cell that could be 4, 7, or 9 - guess what? It must be 9!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h2>2. Box/Line Reduction (The Line Dance)</h2>
            <p>When a number can only appear in two or three cells within a box, AND those cells all line up in the same row or column, that number can't appear anywhere else in that row or column outside the box.</p>
            <p>Think of it like this: if a box has three possible spots for a 6, all in the same row, then that 6 HAS to be in one of those spots. Therefore, 6 can't appear anywhere else in that row outside the box!</p>
