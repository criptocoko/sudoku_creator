            <h2> X-Wing (The Square Dance)</h2>
            <p> Picture this: You find number 4 can only go in two spots in two different rows, and these spots line up in the same columns. You've found an X-Wing! These four cells form a rectangle, and the number must be in two of these spots - one in each row. This means you can eliminate that number as a possibility from any other cells in those columns.</p>

        <div class="technique">
            <h2>Hidden Pairs (The Sneaky Duo)</h2>
            <p> Unlike regular pairs where two cells can only be two numbers, hidden pairs are trickier. You might see two cells that could contain several numbers, but they're the only cells that can contain two specific numbers. Those two cells MUST contain those two numbers, even though they look like they have more options!</p>
