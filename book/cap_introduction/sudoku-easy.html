        <p>Welcome, brave number warrior! Before diving into techniques, remember the golden rule: each row, column, and 3x3 box must contain numbers 1-9 without repeats. Now, let's learn your first weapons of choice:</p>
        
        <div class="technique">
            <h2>1. Single Position (Lone Rangers)</h2>
            <p>Imagine you're filling in a row and notice there's only one empty spot where an 8 could possibly go. That's your Single Position! Look at what numbers are already in the row, column, and box affecting that cell. If only one number fits - bingo! It's like finding the last pizza slice that nobody claimed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h2>2. Single Candidate (Process of Elimination)</h2>
            <p>When a cell has only one possible number that could fit, that's your answer! Check what numbers are already in the related row, column, and box. If only one number is left - you've struck gold! Think of it as musical chairs where only one number can sit.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            <h2>3. Simple Scanning</h2>
            <p>Start with a number (let's say 1) and scan each row and column to see where it could fit. When you find a row or column with only one possible spot for that number - you've found its home! It's like playing 'Where's Waldo?' but way more organized.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="technique">
            Remember: Take notes! Write tiny possible numbers in each empty cell. These 'pencil marks' are like your detective's notebook - they'll help you crack the case!
